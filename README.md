Tweet of War
==================

This project creates a simple visualization from tweets that indicates the daily political leaning of twitter. 

Doesn't this already exist?
---------------------------

Twitter has developed a complex set of rules that it uses to track and determine the sentiment of twitter users about the Obama and Romney on a daily basis.

There is little information about the way that their data is collected. 
> "Think of it as a percentile score; if a candidate has a score of 80, tweets about that candidate were more positive than roughly 80% of all other terms mentioned on Twitter." The accuracy of this system is debated. 

Simplify the Process
--------------------

Tweet of War simply finds tweets where the candidates name or account was mentioned and included an emoticon. The tweet is then indexed positively or negatively. The candidate with a more positive tweets will "pull" harder on the rope.
